# Oracle High Availability (oracle-ha)

In general:

> Availability is the degree to which an application and database service is
> available[^1]

All users want their systems always relaible and ready to return information
and this can be achieved only with the **Hight Availability (HA)**.

# Project history

We created this project to show how the HA can impact client applications
connected to Oracle databases.

This project wants to show the same code, but in different programming
languages, taking advantage of the HA by using the **Oracle CX** driver.

## The structure

Under the folder **examples** there are dimonstrative applications grouped by
programming language.

Folder **orchestration** gives you the possibility to set up a working remote
environment with Ansible[^2].
