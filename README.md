# Oracle High Availability (oracle-ha)

In general:

>  Availability is the degree to which an application and database service is available[^1]

Users, and developers, really want their systems are always ready to provide
information and because of this they need the **High Availability (HA)**.

In this project you can find examples of HA in different programming languages
alongside systems orchestration to setup working environments for demonstrative
purposes.


## Project structure

This project is organized into examples in different programming languages under
the folder **examples** and a configuration management tool with Ansible[^2]
under the folder **orchestrate**.
