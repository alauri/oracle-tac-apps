# The applications

We provide application examples in the following programming languages:

 - Python
 - Golang
 - Java


# Applications commands

All applications behave in the same way and all of them are CLI applications
with the same commands. Their purpose is to show how the *cx_Oracle* driver
can be used in different programming languages to achieve the **HA**.


## The interactive prompt

A interactive prompt to send command to the service manually can be started with
the *human* command:

    oracle-ha human --help


## The automatic interface

All the other commands are job to fire:

    oracle-ha insert --help
    oracle-ha update --help
    oracle-ha delete --help
